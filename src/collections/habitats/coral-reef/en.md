## Overview
Coral reefs are diverse marine ecosystems built by colonies of tiny coral animals that secrete calcium carbonate. Found in warm, shallow ocean waters, they are among the most biodiverse and productive ecosystems on Earth.

## Key Characteristics
- **Location:** Tropical and subtropical oceans, primarily between 30°N and 30°S latitude – prominent examples include the Great Barrier Reef, the Coral Triangle, and Caribbean reefs.
- **Structure:** Built by stony corals (Scleractinia) forming complex three-dimensional habitats.
- **Water Conditions:** Clear, warm (23–29°C), shallow waters with low nutrient levels.
- **Symbiosis:** Corals rely on a mutualistic relationship with zooxanthellae (photosynthetic algae living in coral tissues) for energy.
- **Types:** Fringing reefs, barrier reefs, and atolls.

## Ecological Importance
- **Biodiversity Hotspots:** Home to around 25% of all marine species, including fish, mollusks, crustaceans, and sea turtles.
- **Coastal Protection:** Act as natural breakwaters, reducing wave energy and protecting coastlines from erosion and storms.
- **Fisheries:** Support millions of people worldwide through artisanal and commercial fishing.
- **Carbon Cycling:** Involved in carbon and calcium cycling through coral growth and calcification.
- **Tourism and Economy:** Attract tourists and generate income for coastal communities.

## Threats
- **Coral Bleaching:** Caused by elevated water temperatures that disrupt the coral-algae symbiosis.
- **Ocean Acidification:** Reduces coral calcification rates by lowering the availability of carbonate ions.
- **Pollution:** Runoff, sewage, and plastic waste damage coral tissues and disrupt reef ecosystems.
- **Overfishing:** Depletes key species and alters food web dynamics.
- **Physical Destruction:** From coastal development, anchor damage, and destructive fishing practices.
- **Climate Change:** Rising sea temperatures, stronger storms, and changing ocean chemistry threaten reef survival.

## Conservation Efforts
- **Marine Protected Areas (MPAs):** Safeguard reefs from overexploitation and human impacts.
- **Reef Restoration:** Coral farming and transplanting efforts to rehabilitate degraded reefs.
- **Global Agreements:** International efforts like the Coral Triangle Initiative and the UN Sustainable Development Goals.
- **Research and Monitoring:** Scientific studies track reef health, biodiversity, and environmental stressors.
- **Community Involvement:** Local stewardship and sustainable tourism help protect reef ecosystems.

## Conclusion
Coral reefs are vital marine ecosystems that provide shelter, food, and protection to countless marine species and millions of people. Preserving and restoring these fragile habitats is essential for global biodiversity, food security, and climate resilience.
