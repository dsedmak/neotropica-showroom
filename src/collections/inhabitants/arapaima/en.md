**Distribution:**  
Amazon River basin in South America, especially in Brazil, Peru, and Colombia.

**Habitat:**  
Calm freshwater areas such as slow-flowing rivers, lakes, and floodplains. Often found in shallow waters with dense vegetation.

**Size:**  
One of the largest freshwater fish in the world â€“ can grow up to 3 meters in length and weigh over 200 kg.

**Diet:**  
Carnivorous. Feeds on fish, invertebrates, and occasionally small aquatic birds or mammals.

**Conservation status:**  
Listed as Vulnerable (VU) on the IUCN Red List, mainly due to overfishing and habitat loss.

**Interesting facts:**  
- Has a special organ called a labyrinth that allows it to breathe atmospheric air. This adaptation enables it to survive dry periods when dissolved oxygen levels in the water are very low.  
- Its scales are thick and hard, providing protection from predators such as piranhas. Indigenous people use arapaima scales as blades and arrow tips.  
- It plays an important role in local culture and economy and has been valued as a food source for centuries.  
- Due to its size and behavior, it is also popular in sport fishing.  
- Females lay eggs at the beginning of the rainy season, often in shallow nests along riverbanks.  
- Scientists are still investigating whether there are multiple arapaima species. Currently, the genus *Arapaima* is considered monotypic (only one species), although genetic studies suggest there may be two others: *Arapaima leptosoma* and *Arapaima agassizii*.  
- In Colombia, a 13-million-year-old fossil ancestor of the arapaima was found.  
- *Arapaima* is invasive in Bolivia, across Asia, and in Indonesia.
