**Distribution:**  
Northern part of South America – mainly in the basins of the Amazon and Orinoco rivers, present in Brazil, Venezuela, Guyana, and Suriname.

**Habitat:**  
Shallow, slow-flowing streams and rivers with clean, soft water and dense riparian vegetation. Often found in areas with overhanging plants above the water.

**Size:**  
Grows up to approximately 4–5 cm in length. Males are usually slimmer and more brightly colored than females.

**Diet:**  
Omnivorous. Feeds on small insects, larvae, zooplankton, and plant material.

**Conservation status:**  
Currently not assessed on the IUCN Red List. Locally not threatened, but natural populations may be sensitive to habitat degradation.

**Interesting facts:**  
- Known for its exceptionally unique reproductive behavior – the pair jumps out of the water and lays eggs on the underside of overhanging leaves above the water surface.  
- The male then sprays the eggs with water using its tail to keep them moist until they hatch – one of the few known forms of out-of-water spawning in fish.  
- It is a social species and thrives best in small groups.
