**Interesting facts:**  
- The genus name “Geophagus” means “earth eater,” referring to its feeding method of scooping up substrate and filtering food particles.  
- During breeding, males develop brighter colors and elongated dorsal and caudal fins.  
- One parent (usually the female) mouthbroods the eggs and young to protect them from predators.  
- Due to careless aquarium releases, this species has become invasive in Singapore’s waterways.
