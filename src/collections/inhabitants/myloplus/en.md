**Distribution:**  
River basins of the Amazon, Orinoco, and Essequibo in South America — found in Brazil, Peru, Venezuela, Colombia, and Guyana.

**Habitat:**  
Slow-flowing rivers, lakes, and floodplains with dense vegetation. Usually stays in mid to lower water layers near submerged wood and shoreline plants.

**Size:**  
In the wild, it can grow up to 40 cm; in aquariums, usually reaches 25–30 cm.

**Diet:**  
Mostly herbivorous, but can be omnivorous. Feeds on plant material, fruits, seeds, and occasionally invertebrates or detritus.

**Conservation status:**  
Not currently assessed by IUCN. Wild populations are generally stable, though local threats include fishing and habitat destruction.

**Interesting facts:**  
- Also called the “discus metynnis” because of its similarity to other flat-bodied characins, but it is a distinct species with a pronounced black vertical band on its body.  
- Plays a role in seed dispersal in the wild by eating fruits that fall into the water, aiding plant reproduction.  
- During spawning, males develop more intense coloration and may display aggressive behavior toward rivals.
