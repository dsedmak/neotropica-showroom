**Distribution:**  
Western part of the Amazon River basin — mainly Brazil, Peru, and Colombia.

**Habitat:**  
Dark, soft, and acidic waters of slow-flowing tributaries and streams (so-called “blackwater”), often under dense rainforest canopy. Prefers the lower to middle water layers.

**Size:**  
Grows up to about 3–4 cm in length.

**Diet:**  
Omnivorous. Feeds on small invertebrates, larvae, plankton, and plant material.

**Conservation status:**  
Not threatened according to the IUCN Red List. Due to wide distribution and extensive aquarium breeding, wild populations are not under significant pressure.

**Interesting facts:**  
- One of the most popular ornamental fish worldwide, known for its shiny blue stripe and bright red coloration on the lower body.  
- The name “neon” comes from its fluorescent appearance, especially visible in darker water.  
- First described in 1936 by George S. Myers, who named it after the American aquarist, photographer, author, and publisher William T. Innes.  
- In the wild, breeding often occurs during the rainy season, stimulated by soft, acidic water and lower temperatures.  
- Neon tetras can change their coloration due to special skin cells called iridophores, which contain guanine crystals that reflect light differently.  
- There are also the green neon tetra (*Paracheirodon simulans*) and the cardinal tetra (*Paracheirodon axelrodi*), which differ from the common neon tetra in coloration and geographical distribution.
