## Distribution  
Drainage basins of the Amazon, Orinoco, and Paraná-Paraguay rivers in South America.

## Habitat  
Freshwater rivers and tributaries, preferably found on sandy or muddy bottoms where it can bury itself.

## Size  
Disc diameter usually reaches up to 50 cm, although larger specimens have been reported.

## Diet  
Carnivorous, scavenger. Feeds on various invertebrates (insects, crustaceans, snails) and carrion found on the riverbed.

## Conservation status  
Currently classified as Data Deficient (DD) on the IUCN Red List, meaning there is insufficient information to assess its risk of extinction.

## Interesting facts  
- One of the few species of freshwater stingrays.  
- Recognizable by its distinct bright orange-yellow spots on a darker back. Each pattern is unique to the individual and varies significantly between rivers, depending on the substrate color.  
- Has one or more serrated venomous barbs on its tail used for defense. The sting can be very painful.  
- It is viviparous – females give birth to live young.
