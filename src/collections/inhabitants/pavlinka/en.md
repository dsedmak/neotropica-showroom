## Conservation status

## Interesting facts  
- Has a long lifespan and is known for calm but territorial behavior, especially during spawning.  
- Helps disperse seeds in the wild, as it feeds on fruits that fall into the water.  
- A substrate spawner – pairs select a surface (stone, root), clean it, and lay eggs on it.  
- Both parents actively guard eggs and fry, showing high parental care.
