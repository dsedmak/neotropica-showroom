**Distribution:**  
Restricted to some rivers in Peru, mainly in the Ucayali River basin, which is part of the greater Amazon system.

**Habitat:**  
Slow-flowing tropical freshwater rivers and bays with dense riparian vegetation, submerged roots, and branches. Often found in the middle to lower water layers.

**Size:**  
In aquarium conditions, grows to about 20–25 cm in height (including fins); can grow slightly larger in the wild.

**Diet:**  
Omnivorous. Feeds on small invertebrates, zooplankton, plant material, and detritus.

**Conservation status:**  
Not yet assessed by the IUCN Red List due to lack of data, but local pressure from aquarium trade collection may pose a risk.

**Interesting facts:**  
- Closely related to the better-known Altum (*Pterophyllum altum*), and often mistaken for angelfish, but considered a separate species — its status is still not fully clarified and remains under debate.  
- Valued among aquarium enthusiasts for its upright, triangular body shape and elegant fins.  
- Sensitive to water quality — requires soft, acidic, and very clean water.  
- A member of the cichlid family that cares for its offspring — breeding pairs usually clean the substrate where they lay eggs and then guard the young.
