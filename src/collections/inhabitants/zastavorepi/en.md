**Distribution:**  
Found in the Amazon and Orinoco river basins in South America — widespread in Brazil, Peru, Colombia, and Venezuela.

**Habitat:**  
Inhabits slow-flowing tropical rivers, floodplains, lagoons, and seasonally flooded areas with abundant underwater vegetation.

**Size:**  
Adults can reach up to 30 cm in length, sometimes larger in the wild. They have a characteristic tall, laterally compressed body.

**Diet:**  
Omnivorous. Primarily feeds on algae, detritus, plankton, and plant particles. Often "grazes" on the substrate like herbivorous animals.

**Conservation status:**  
Not specifically assessed on the IUCN Red List. However, it has economic importance as a food fish, which may impact local populations.

**Interesting facts:**  
- Recognizable by multiple black vertical stripes on its body and a distinctive banded tail, which gives it its Latin name ("taeniurus" = banded tail).  
- Possesses strong fins with reddish coloration that becomes more pronounced during the spawning season.  
- Performs seasonal migrations to spawning grounds, often in large schools — somewhat similar to salmon but in tropical rivers.  
- An important food fish for local communities and often farmed in fish hatcheries.
